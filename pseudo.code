# 📌 Ride Logger - Pseudo Code
# Logs location data efficiently with smart logic for city & highway rides.

START LOGGER:
    INITIALIZE GPS, Gyroscope, Accelerometer, and other required sensors
    SET mode = "CITY"  # Default mode (switches dynamically)

    WHILE ride is active:
        GET current timestamp
        GET GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
        GET current speed
        GET current bearing (direction)
        GET current elevation

        # 🔄 Dynamic Mode Switching
        IF speed > 60 km/h AND mode != "HIGHWAY":
            SET mode = "HIGHWAY"
        ELSE IF speed <= 40 km/h AND mode != "CITY":
            SET mode = "CITY"

        # 📍 CITY MODE: High Detail Logging
        IF mode == "CITY":
            IF TURN DETECTED (bearing change ≥ 45° OR gyroscope detects rotation):
                LOG DATA
            ELSE IF distance moved >= 10m OR time since last log >= 3s:
                LOG DATA

        # 🏍️ HIGHWAY MODE: Optimized Logging
        ELSE IF mode == "HIGHWAY":
            IF distance moved >= 50m OR time since last log >= 10s:
                LOG DATA

        # 🛠 Additional Data Enhancements
        IF barometer available:
            GET accurate elevation
        IF accelerometer detects major lateral movement:
            LOG "Significant movement event"

        SLEEP for a short duration to optimize battery usage (e.g., 500ms - 1s)

STOP LOGGER:
    SAVE all logged data to GPX format
    EXPORT file for manual sharing
    CLOSE all sensors and free up resources
